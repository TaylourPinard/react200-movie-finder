# react200-movie-finder
Multi-page react application, search for a movie and have the results shown with some information about each result as well as
the poster for that movie/game. Click "movie information" to be taken to a second screen with more information about that movie.
To run this application after cloning it, navigate into the project repository and run "npm install" when that finishes, run
"npm start" the project should then be visible in your browser at localhost:3000, Or if you just want to see the project running
I have it hosted at https://taylourp-react200-movie-finder.herokuapp.com/
